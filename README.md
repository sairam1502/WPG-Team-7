Project Description :The Prototype Creator for Web Developers is an innovative tool that enables rapid website prototyping based on client requirements. Users can either provide a natural language description or select options from a dropdown
menu for five key parameters (e.g., layout, theme, functionality). Using this input, the tool dynamically generates a customized web prototype through API integration, streamlining the design process and producing responsive, code-ready outputs that match the client's vision.
